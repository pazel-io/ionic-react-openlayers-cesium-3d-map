# Ionic, React, OpenLayers CesiumJS 3d map

An example project to show how you can add 3d maps to your Ionic apps.

All the heavy lifting is done for you thanks to Cesium.js and olcs (OpenLayers - Cesium integration library).

The rest of code is just a typical OpenLayers map app.

Project uses React 17, Ionic 5 and OpenLayers 6.



## Installation

I use NVM for node version managemnet, hence you have .nvrc it the root but that is optional.


Install with npm

```bash
  npm install
  npm start
```
